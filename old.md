Deploying modern web apps often means juggling configuration for multiple environmentsâ€”development, staging, productionâ€”while keeping your build artifacts immutable. In this post, Iâ€™ll walk through how to set up dynamic environment variables in a Vite-based front end so that you can bake sensible defaults at build time, yet override them at container startup without rebuilding. The complete example is available on GitHub:

## Why dynamic env vars?

Out of the box, Vite injects any variable prefixed with `VITE_` into your client code at build time. Thatâ€™s great for local development:

```properties
# app/.env.production
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_FEATURE_FLAG=true
```

But what if you want to deploy the **same** container image to staging or production and tweak these values on the fly? Traditionally youâ€™d need to rebuild for each environment or write extra server-side logic. Instead, we can:

1. **Build once** with sensible defaults (in `app/.env.production`),
2. **Ship** the static files into an NGINX container,
3. **Run** a tiny shell script on startup (`app/env.sh`) that walks through any prefixed vars and `sed`-replaces placeholders in the built files, and
4. **Override** defaults simply by passing new values via Docker Compose or `docker run`.

## High-level flow

Below is a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the entire process, from writing your `.env` to serving the final HTML/JS to the client:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph Build-Time
    Dev[Developer] -->|writes defaults| EnvFile[.env.production]
    EnvFile -->|imported by| ViteBuild[Vite build]
    ViteBuild -->|outputs| Dist[/dist artifacts/]
  end

  subgraph Image-Build
    Dist -->|copied into| BuildStage[Node build container]
    BuildStage -->|bundles & minifies| DistFinal[/usr/src/app/dist/]
    DistFinal -->|transferred to| Runtime[Nginx runtime image]
  end

  subgraph Runtime
    Runtime -->|contains| EnvScript[env.sh]
    Compose[Docker Compose] -->|provides| EnvVars[APP_ENV_PREFIX & VITE_* vars]
    EnvVars -->|read by| EnvScript
    EnvScript -->|`sed`-replaces| Served["/usr/share/nginx/html/web-app & /tmpl/dist/web-app"]
    Served -->|served to| Browser[Client browser]
  end
```

## 1. Build-time defaults: `app/.env.production`

Keep all your default values here. Any variable prefixed with `VITE_` will be statically inlined by Vite:

```properties
# app/.env.production
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_FEATURE_FLAG=true
VITE_VALUE=PREFIX_VALUE
```

These values live in your Git history and ensure that anyone cloning the repo can immediately build and run a working app.

---

## 2. Runtime replacement: `app/env.sh`

At container startup, we need to replace every placeholder (e.g. `VITE_API_URL`) in the built files with actual environment variables. Hereâ€™s a minimal shell script that:

* Requires an `APP_ENV_PREFIX` (e.g. `VITE_`)
* Iterates over all matching env vars
* Uses `sed` to swap each key for its value

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# app/env.sh

if [ -z "$APP_ENV_PREFIX" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: APP_ENV_PREFIX is not set."
  exit 1
fi

env | grep "^${APP_ENV_PREFIX}" | while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
  echo "Replacing $key â†’ $value"
  find "/usr/share/nginx/html/web-app" -type f -exec sed -i "s|${key}|${value}|g" {} +
  find "/tmpl/dist/web-app"  -type f -exec sed -i "s|${key}|${value}|g" {} +
done
```

By placing this script under `/docker-entrypoint.d/`, NGINX (via the official Alpine image) will execute it automatically before launching.

---

## 3. Multi-stage Dockerfile: `app/Dockerfile`

A lean multi-stage build that produces a static bundle and then a tiny runtime image:

```dockerfile
# app/Dockerfile

# â€” Build stage â€”
FROM node:hydrogen-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build --mode=production

# â€” Runtime stage â€”
FROM nginx:mainline-alpine3.18-perl
# (Optional) Custom nginx config
COPY .nginx/${NGINX_CONFIG_FILE:-nginx.conf} /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html/web-app
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist /tmpl/dist/web-app

# Add env replacement script
COPY app/env.sh /docker-entrypoint.d/env.sh
RUN dos2unix /docker-entrypoint.d/env.sh \
 && chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.d/env.sh

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Key points:**

* We copy `dist` twice: once to serve directly, and once to a secondary path for any other templating needs.
* The entrypoint directory is baked into the Alpine NGINX image, so our script auto-runs.

## 4. Configuration & overrides: `docker-compose.yml`

Instead of rebuilding for each environment, supply overrides at runtime:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: webapp:latest
    environment:
      APP_ENV_PREFIX: VITE_
      # Override any VITE_ var hereâ€”no rebuild needed
      VITE_API_URL: "https://staging-api.example.com"
      VITE_FEATURE_FLAG: "false"
      VITE_VALUE: "Injected at runtime"
```

With this in place, you can:

* **Build once**: `docker-compose up --build`
* **Override later**:

  ```bash
  VITE_VALUE="Hello from Host!" docker-compose up --no-build
  ```

---

## Conclusion

By combining Viteâ€™s `VITE_`-prefix convention, a tiny startup script, and Docker Compose overrides, you achieve:

* **Immutable builds**â€”same image across environments
* **Runtime flexibility**â€”switch APIs, feature flags, or any other setting without rebuilding
* **Clear defaults**â€”stored in version control for reproducibility
